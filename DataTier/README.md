# DataSynthesis-Data Tier
The DataSynthesis Data Tier is the ONLY focused around the datamodel/data tier core asset(s). 
For simplicity sake this is focused around the DDLs (Database Defintion Language),
Data Loaders (bulk loaders - SQL insert scripts) and DataTier-APIs (APIs to access the data and
as needed generate more data) that can be used.

## More Details and Implementation Information
For the path forward we wanted to include content to walk teams through the various aspects of the 
data tier.

Stay safe, stay strong and carry on!!! Happy Coding!!!!
