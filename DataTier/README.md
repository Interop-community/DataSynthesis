# DataSynthesis-Data Tier
The DataSynthesis Data Tier is the core assets that make up and DDLs or Data Loaders that can be used.
DataSynthesis was started after my personal struggle with being able to leverage
data for any level of integration, application development, varying data related
(Data Warehouse, Big Data, Relational Data, AI/ML). This struggle had gone on for 
several decades as we worked on integration across the US, Canada, and now globally including
thousands of hospitals, numerous payers and several life sciences companies. 

As we thought about the problem I had also started to become more focused on open source
software and industry initiatives. We went in with the expectations that many solutions must exist
to solve this problem and it was just a matter of me learning how to use one or stitch a few together.

## The Implementation Path Forward

For the path forward we wanted to include content to walk teams through the various aspects of the 
data tier.
