# Background
As we focus on <b>data being the asset</b> We wanted to ensure we brought forward a data enablement capability.
Our logic was simple, for years companies have focused on most aspects of development, from the tooling to developing 
the next generation of solutions to support their business needs and provide value. However, building great software 
to help today's modern needs require data, massive amounts of production like data. While there are several great other 
open source offerings out there we wanted to build something based on several of their capabilities and add additional
capabilities over time. How and why is this the case? Data is the electricity that powers business and the cornerstone 
of companiesâ€™ success in the digital era. 

With data being so critical, what is your companies focus on the need for meaningful realistic world based testing data? 
To be a data-driven organization requires an overarching testing data culture that couples a number of elements, including 
high-quality production like data, broad access and data literacy along with appropriate data-driven decision-making 
governance and guidance processes. Companies that are successful in this space are quick at using data for all 
aspects of their business needs successfully and are quick to spot opportunities, quick to
assess ideas and adapt quickly to test, learn and drive future capabilities and needs from these experiences.

The Data Synthesis platform is designed to generate and/or leverage and build upon one hundred percent freely available 
information along with a subset of extensible data attributes and augment or construct it for various business needs. 
The idea for Data Synthesis is in NO WAY new or unique, it comes from the struggle that every organization with 
every resource on every project I have ever worked on. A data-driven organization does not have to come at a high price. 
While it sounds complicated it is really about providing businesses a means for data collection, cleansing, hosting 
and maintenance data while mitigating the risk of a data breach thru comprehensive testing processes and practices. 
Data-driven organization can innovate continuously because they understand and can embrace new business models quickly. 
Why should orgainzations risk <a href="https://www.breachlevelindex.com/" target="_blank">data breaches</a> or the 
potential leakage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_health_information" target="_blank">PHI (in healthcare)</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data" target="_blank">PII (In any other industry)</a>? In today's 
technology world we wanted to enable a new and different way to innovate within a data-driven organization, synthetic data.

Synthetic data is defined as: "any production data applicable to a given situation that are not obtained by direct 
measurement" according to the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms; where Craig S. Mullins, 
an expert in data management, defines production data as"information that is persistently stored and used by 
professionals to conduct business processes." With these definitions it is easy to understand the creation of 
synthetic data is an involved process that can be achieved by numerous measures and ways. Our way was to create a platform to
synthesize data (Data Synthesis) for multiple needs based on items like industry standards, vendor data models, 
custom defined models all in an on-demand manner.

Data Synthesis has always intended to be operated under the open/community source model. This means we are providing
the code for community enhancements and improvements to support the growth of underlying data access capabilities. We are 
currently working on standing up the necessary artifacts. The code assets include a Web UI (at some point), APIs 
and the core repository patterns used to access the data structures offered within the platform. DataSynthesis open source 
licensing model is <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0" target="_blank">Apache-2.0</a>.

# How Data Synthesis is Structured


# Uses for DataSynthesis

* Enterprise-wide data
* Industry standards
* Vendor-specific, and custom-designed data and models
* On-demand access (tDaaS)
* External data from any source
* Microservices/API access
* Any/multiple layers of metadata
* Leverage the latest technology and be able to build out capabilities that accurately represent production data without exposing it</li>
